## How it was made
The game was coded in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.

After that I converted it into a EXE, macOS, Linux application using <a href="https://github.com/Nether-Quest/exe-packager">a EXE converter</a> by TurboWarp.

I also generated a <a href="https://github.com/Nether-Quest/Plain-HTML">HTML file</a> and converted it into a <a href="https://appsgeyser.com/blog/convert-html-to-apk-for-free">apk file</a> for android.
